<strong>The <u>CSS Working</u> Grouphas</strong> published Selectors Level 3 as a W3C Recommendation. Selectors are patterns that match against elements in a tree, and as such form one of several technologies that can be used to select nodes in an HTML or XML document. Selectors have been optimized for use with HTML and XML, and are designed to be usable in performance-critical code.

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/" target="_blank" title="Apple">W3C is a growing and global community</a> where participants choose to work together, and in that process experience differences in language, location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment, misunderstandings and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be resolved informally. In rare cases, however, behavior can intimidate, harass, or otherwise disrupt one or more people in the community, which W3C will not tolerate.
A Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct is useful to define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of professional practice.</p><p style="margin-top:20px">It also provides a benchmark for self evaluation and acts as a vehicle for better identity of the organization.
This code (CEPC), complemented by a set of Procedures, applies to any member of the W3C community â€“ staff, members, invited experts, participants in W3C meetings, W3C teleconferences, W3C mailing lists, W3C conference or W3C functions, etc. Note that this code complements rather than replaces legal rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation.
Education and training materials are available from the Positive Work Environment public homepage.
